# Stardew Cropper

This project is something I've been needing for a while. I have a vast collection of spreadsheets for Stardew Valley that have just become bloated with too much info. This is my attempt to pair some of that down.

## Goals:

First concern is implementing proper tables for each seasons crops, complete with sorting, and price projections for amounts of sprinklers, skill, etc.

Second I will put an easy to use bundle tracking component to make keeping track of what you need for bundles a little bit easier.
